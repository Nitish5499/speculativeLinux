This is our CSE 506 Project - Implementing Speculative Execution using custom system calls in the Linux Kernel.

The kernel can be compiled using the following commands :
1. sudo make -j$(nproc)
2. sudo make modules_install
3. sudo make install
4. sudo update-grub
5. reboot

The following system calls were added:
1. create_spec - to create a checkpointed process
2. move_to_waitqueue - move the current process to the wait queue
3. commit_spec - commit the current speculation and kill the checkpointed process
4. fail_spec - bring the checkpointed process from wait queue( state INTERRUPTIBLE) to ready. The current process will be idled.

Registered System Calls are visible in the file /proc/kallsyms

The evaluation codes are for the different scenarios given in the project report. 

They can be compiled as gcc -o <enter output object name> <file_name>.c
and timed using time ./<output object/executable>

System calls can be traced using strace -f ./<output object/executable>
